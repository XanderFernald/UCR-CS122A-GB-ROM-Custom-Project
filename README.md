# UCR-CS122A-GB-ROM-Custom-Project
My first attempts at Gameboy ROM(s) for my Intermediate Embedded Systems class at UCR.

Each folder is a VS Code workspace for a ROM which tests some aspect(s) of GameBoy programming. The files with the .gb extensions are the compiled ROMs.

This project uses the GBDK (GameBoy Developer Kit) to write these ROMs, as well as the BGB emulator to test them.
